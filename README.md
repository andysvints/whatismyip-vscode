# What Is My IP

This is simple yet handy VS Code extension that shows the public IP address of the development endpoint you're working on. It utilizes the [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) and [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) APIs to fetch and display your public IP address information.

## Features

### Automatic IP Fetching

Retrieves your public IP address automatically when VS Code starts.
